# SignalReplacement
A simple custom signal system that does not use Bindables. Meant to replicate the old rbxUtility:CreateSignal() while adding more flexibility

# How to use
Both scripts are module scripts. Connection is a child of Signal. I recommend putting the system in ReplicatedStorage, preferably in a dedicated "Modules" folder there.
